  1)  Find the Almighty and Omnipotent SPUR and defeat him in battle.

In addition, ye may be required to:

  1)  Find the MAGIC item required.
  2)  Attain wealth by acquiring GOLD through your conquests of demons.

Ye  may find clues as to what exactly is required of you scripted in books  or
scrolls  within  the  LAND.   The challenge set forth is not  an  easy  one... 
However, there are these commands that ye may use once you enter the dungeon:

levels.   Along the way you will encounter many demons and monsters.   If  you
are brave and fight well you will be rewarded for your efforts.
