BUGS:

Missing label error after combat. Gene's not sure where that occurs.

Listing type of spell doesn't display SPELL.TYPES

When Storm Weapon is picked up, then USEd, truncates name of weapon.
Also happens when MYSTERIO WEAPON DISINTEGRATES.

Syntax error after editing weapon type in sysop editor.
Occasionally battle locks up. Not sure why.

Annex: if you enter it first thing off "LOS" menu, ? crashes with "message file not found" - I think drive prefixes aren't assigned there vs. are in SPUR.MAIN?
