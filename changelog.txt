===============================================================================

2/23/2011:	*** TODO items are in separate file TODO.TXT ***

6/11/2006:
CHANGE	"create playerlog" on adventure.d81: now creates 
	  "e.t.playerlog" instead of "e.t.p", on current drive instead of
	  drive 8 only.
FIXED	Fixed tokenization error: when saving program with Tuned 
	  Simons' BASIC, "play" in REM statements is tokenized into "D!".

NEW	Added link to VICE homepage on TLOS_TADA group.

WIP	Due to the C=-G/C=-H and C=-M/C=-N "bugs" in the Commodore 
	  character set, characters suitable for building a "pixellated"
	  horizontal bar graph were reworked - 2/4/6/8 pixels. The
	  progress bar still looks jumpy, though.

WIP	"bar graph 2" is being reworked to use standard Kernal PLOT
	  routines to draw the "thermometer bar" bounding box.

7/14/2006:
FIXED	"spells" file to create spell list renamed to "create spells". 
	  Creates "e.t.spells" on current drive. Checks if file exists.

OTHER	Other stats (spell type, as per SPUR) should be saved. To-
	  cast percentage should be saved too.

DOCS	Mostly complete list of spell types and effects:

        Spell Types:		Succeed			Backfires
        ------------		-------			---------
        (A)ura			Combat bonuses		?
        (C)onstitution		?			?
        (D)exterity		More dextrous		Less dextrous
        (E)nergy		Feel stronger		Feel weaker
        (G)et SPUR		Battle SPUR		(SPUR not here?)
        (I)ntelligence		More intelligent	You feel dumber
        (L)evel-Down		Move level down		Move level up
        (M)onster      		Weaken			Strengthen
        (P)layer		Increase HP		Decrease HP
        (R)eturn to Shop	Go to Shop		Monster freezes you
        (S)trength		Strengthen		Weaken player
        (T)ransfer		Gold goes to bank	Carry all gold
        (U)p-Level		Move one level up	Move one level down
        (W)isdom		Become wiser		Become more foolish

WIP	Starting to break up disk images into one big directory and list 
	  contents using BASTEXT, then compare changes using EditPad Pro.

7/19/2006:
NEW	Put large chunks of text to be displayed in "t.np21" into "s.tada 
	  messages".
NEW/	"new plr msgs": file the text was extracted from. Weighing 
WIP	  in at 11 blocks, that'll cut down on the size of t.np21. (this is on 
	  adventure.d81) It'll follow the "spur messages" file format, which is
	  to be determined, and could be extended to all programs.

7/20/06
NEW	t.np22 extracted from Linux-side disk image. No major changes, just 
	  neatened up a few things. Still, included it in file archive for 
	  completeness.

7/21/06
FIXED	lowercased all filenames, removed *.prg extensions where necessary
FIXED	t.stat22: right-aligned "Horse" and "Front/Flank/Point/Rear 
	  Guard", made it skip shield rating for horse, thusly:
              Point guard:
              Flank guard:
               Rear guard:
                    Horse:
INFO	"lockers" installer is corrupt. No big deal.

7/22/06:
FIXES	"combo" series of programs (t.startup + t.main):
	* Can finally enter text in lowercase in the parser. 
	  (lowercase -> uppercase I$ converter)
	* Made the clock actually display something.
	* Working on the BASIC "INSTR" parser
	* File reader works now. Use Home to pause, space or / to abort
	* More intelligent handling of dc$ (next command)
	* Grabs parameters from cmdline (tries to, anyway)
	* Cleaned out dead code, reorganized
	* Map movement possible now! Again! For the third time!
	  Let's hope it STAYS this way.

7/25/06:
CHANGE	Long filenames. Easier on the brain.
		t.ma.a.a   ->	t.ma.a.ammo
		e.t.z	   ->	e.t.ammo
		e.t.f	   ->	e.t.rations
			etc.

FIXED	"t.ma.elevator": Added more levels, inverted logic moving between
	  levels: instead of moving 7...1 with (U)p, (D)own does the trick.

FIXED	Tidied up "create rations" and "t.ma.gen-store", now use current drive 
	  and Input Any routines

7/27/06:
NEW	Used "saver" routine to finally create a binary of MODULE 64, called 
	  "module64.obj" on disk. No more DATA statements!

7/30/06:
OTHER	I'd like to look at Tuned Simons' BASIC to -quickly- implement The Land 
	  of Spur. It has labels, and what appears to be a MOD function. No 
	  docs on how to use the original Simons' BASIC, I know it's packed 
	  away in a box somewhere...
UPDATE	Found an e-text version on an earlier archive CD. Now included in 
	  \docs\commodore
CHANGE	Renamed "ia" to "input any $c000". Found another version on LoadStar 
	  #132 that does the same thing, runs in cassette buffer ($033C).
INFO	Order of parameters are opposite between the two files.
	  (channel,bytes [$033c] vs. bytes,channel [$c000])
FIXED	Imported "room.level1" file into descriptionwork.d81, will write a 
	  program to strip high bits from ASCII descs.
	Truncated the first 5128 bytes from the file so the file read goes 
	  faster... also converted from plain ASCII to Commodore ASCII. That 
	  might make things easier.
REMOVE	Most of this was later found to be unneccessary, Skip's "SPUR Room 
	  Text" file contains text for levels 1-6, not 7.
CHANGE	All files in SPUR-(code|data) now read-only.

8/05/06:
NEW	Exported room desc hex dumps from CiderPress into EditPad Pro. You can 
	  read descs now, but letters are still missing...
UPDATE	This too is mostly unneccessary, except for level 7 (THE HOUSE).
WISH	STAT program needs some concept of whether allies are good or evil?

08/08/2006:
CHANGES	wrote '16' to workdisk.d64. Trying to come up with an improved player 
	  log writer following changes of 8/6/06. Trying to untangle kangaroo 
	  code, but resulting code doesn't work. :/
UPDATE	Reverted to 'create log 16' in 'installers' directory. Merged changes. 
NEW	Saved 'create log 7' on workdisk.d64 (newer version of "create 
	  playerlog")

08/13/2006:
OTHER	I guess just the JiffyDOS routines in VICE are to blame, I booted using 
	  stock ROMs and "e.t.playerlog" reads fine instead of locking up VICE.
NEW	Started work on t.ma.olaf -- slave trading. 90+ allies on workdisk.d64
UPDATE	First major backup in a while :)

08/16/2006:
FIXED	Changed variable X to Y in subroutine at 2850 (display comma-delimited 
	  value). On returning, X trashed original passed value.
DOCS	Updated "TADA_Subroutines" to reflect this. Also:

BUG?	Doesn't handle negative or fractional numbers, or variable 
          column widths. Is this something to consider? For example, in 
          t.np/t.stat, there's a lot of right-justified 2/3-digit 
          numbers being displayed by a different subroutine (lines 375-
          378 I believe) when you roll your character's stats.

FIXED	Minor bug where justified numbers were getting an extra space 
	  displayed before the number. This was removed for consistency in 
	  needing/not needing to display a leading space before calling the 
	  routine. (Compare, for example, t.vin24 to t.vin25.)

FIXED	Numbers less than 1000 now displayed correctly.

8/17/2006:
BUG	t.ma.olaf doesn't subtract gold from player's account correctly, and 
	  locks up occasionally when selecting ally to buy.

08/20/2006:
DOCS	Differentiated Fist guild (f)/underground forest (F) on level 1 map.
WISH	Have a separate file with weapon experience? 2 bytes per weapon?

8/26/2006:
FIXED	Added more error-checking/intelligence to the save/quit routines in 
	  player editor.
NEW	Now flags changes that need to be saved, and only asks to save after 
	  something has been changed.
NEW	Also checks error channel when saving.
CHANGE	Editor doesn't go back to player listing if you say "no" to exiting.

WIP	adding/fixing more stuff in tep... saved tep23 on adventure.d81 -- 
	  pushing 60 blocks... so much time, so little to *do*...

8/27/2006:
CHANGE	The Great Renumbering of tep. 
DOCS	Details in "programming-notes\tep subroutines.txt"

9/03/2006:
WIP	After struggling with parts of tep rampantly POKEing over the program, 
	  I've switched to another sub-project.
NEW	Made a weapons file creator, cleaned up a few extra fields. 
	  t.ma.arm.weapons will have to be rewritten.

CHANGE	Added xx-xx-xx combo style and a few snarky comments in t.ma.elevator

NEW	"monsterenum" program goes through monster flags and displays in
	  English what the flags mean.
DONE	Bring this over into the collective from my C128.

9/04/2006:
CHANGE	rewrote t.ma.arm.weapons display list to be compatible with new 
	  e.t.weapons file.

10/06/2006
NEW	saved t.bar.olaf13 in mydocs\tada\prgs

INFO	Lots of work to do on the Tuned Simons' BASIC version of 
	  "spur.combat.s". It's coming along, though.

10/17/2006
DOCS	Finished book texts file. Some small spots need clarification.
CHANGE	Moved a few duplicate, redundant, or outdated .zip and 
	  .prg files out of the archive to cut down space requirements,
	  moved them into a local directory called "not-archived".
CHANGE	Finally updating %-sub-asm.txt to remove references to someone who 
	  doesn't like me anymore. Long story.
WIP	Anyway, the BASIC part at line 500 works fine. ML does not. Maybe now 
	  that I  know more about ML, I can fixz0r it.
CHANGE	Moved a few files around, yay. They're in a better place, now.
DOCS	"tree" and "changelog" go in root directory. Easier to find.
DOCS	Added Simons' BASIC reference and dumped the text of Arndt Dettke's 
	  Tuned Simons' BASIC to a SEQ file, then exported to text.
DOCS	Added some text from Skip's BBS to the text files section. 
 	  Unfortunately I can't find the original, unmodified part where I 
 	  signed on for the first time to his BBS, I had changed it thinking I 
 	  would do something similar on my BBS. But you should get the idea.

10/23/2006
WISH	Create records in room description files where oft-repeated phrases 
	  like "You are in a maze." can simply point to this record instead of 
	  taking up duplicate records.

(Somewhere between 10/2006 and 1/2007)
NEW	Wrote a mostly working INSTRing routine in assembly! INSTR2.OBJ
BUG	Works great on one-character matches, but returns position of last 	
	  character matched in >1 character matches.
FIXED	Debugged.

adventure.d81:
INFO	* ace[1-10]: automatic command entry. (if expert mode off)
	    many bugs. barely started. Too bad I got fed up with the original 
	    which WORKED, years ago, and deleted it... sigh. Maybe it'll make 
	    an appearance in v2.0. Has to be SOME reason to upgrade! :>
BUG	* t.np22 (TADA.New Player routine). This is the latest one.
	    Choosing a random age doesn't always seem to pick numbers in the 
	    range of 15-50. Also needs to close disk channels at exit. A 
	    few cosmetic bugs.
WISH	Add a short menu of commands on the left of the Wall Bar & Grill
	  display if expert mode is off: X=Mundo, I$=person. Also have
	  Mundo positioned in the doorway thusly: ---|X|---
	  (or perhaps "M" for Mundo...)

1/23/2007
CHANGE	GZipped all the disk images to cut down on space requirements. VICE
	  opens *.gz images just fine (although read-only). I heart 7Zip!

1/24/2007
NEW	Since I'm home from college sick as a dog (yesterday too but I had no
	  choice but to take my math test), I had some time to work on some
	  things. Finally wrote a M$-DOS batch file that automates creation
	  of the "filelist.txt" file listing in each directory. :) This will 
	  replace the "tree.txt" files as soon as I move the descriptions out 
	  of those files.
WISH	Add a backup feature, since typing descriptions of files into each 
	  filelist.txt file and having them overwritten would suck rocks.
	  Perhaps a file compare/merge...
WISH	Learn enough 'bash' scripting in Linux to do the same thing for Linux 
	  brethren. Or have someone do it for me. :)
UPDATE	December 2007: "Intro to Linux scripting" college course helped a lot!
BUG	tep does not write "to hit%" in the right spot when getting ally (ends 
	  up 0%) Pulled this out of "tep layout.txt"
INFO	Note to self: Self, I put my EditPad Pro Clip Collection in not-
	  archived\

3/4/2007
DOCS	Added a note about pausing LIST in SysRes, using space and C= keys.

3/21/2007
FIXED	Some typos and undefined statement errors in the TSB version of
	  the combat module "17" on combat-work-disk.d81
NEW	Made keys repeat, for now.

4/9/2007
DOCS	"making modules" in \programming-notes directory: finally get Module
	   64 showing off more than the Compute!'s Gazette demo... need an
           artificial amount of space reserved at setup, and error checking to 
	   make sure a "file not found" error doesn't GOSUB 20 anyway.
	   And copy f$ (name of module) into another string to prevent un-
	   necessary file loads when saved string=f$.
	   
4/14/2007
WIP	Created "module-work-disk.d81" and put the latest versions of:
	  combo20		(t.startup + t.main)
	  makeplayerlog18	makes player log, v1.8
	  image subs		has swapped Input Any params + close2
	  	last updated 6/10/2007
	  tep60			latest version anywhere
	  	last updated 6/10/2007
	  t.np23		latest version anywhere
	  t.startup		now reserves ~50 blocks of space, experimenting
	  				with the right amount of space so prgs
	  				don't collide in memory

	I think I want to handle items being cursed differently than TLOS did;
	"TADA_Variables.txt" now reflects this. Uppercase flag (ABDFMPS) means
	normal item, lowercase flag means non-EXAMINEd cursed item. After a
	successful EXAMINE, flag then changes to "C" for INVentory to 
	reflect a flag like "(Cursed)" after player knows for sure item is 
	cursed.

4/15/2007
INFO	Wow. Microsoft's SyncToy rocks... exactly what I've been looking for
	to keep this project synced between three computers! Between that and 
	EditPad Pro's file compare feature, updates are almost *fun*.

5/5/2007
BUG	Either the "make playerlog 1.8" or "t.np" leaves one space too many
	after the last character in the player's name. # of plays is then set
	to 32.

6/11/2007 (happy birthday, CHANGELOG):
NEW	Unified ML ("ML.O") now working. Runs at $C000. FINAL.BAS demonstrates
	  usage.
	  SYS 49152,"search_thru","search_for"		instring  (is)
	  SYS 49155,<channel_number>,<bytes>,<skipcr>	input any (ia)
	  SYS 49158,"filename"				module 64 (ml)
	  SYS 49161					popstack  (po)

FIXED	Eowyn (ally 73) to hit % no longer is 990% in "make allies 1.2"

NEW	"make monsters" (module-work-disk.d81) works, generates "e.t.monsters".

BUG	Found a bug in Peter Schepers' 64COPY - making a .D81 subdirectory 
	  fills dir header with $00 instead of $A0. Will email him.
UPDATE	Resolved.
	  
FIXED	tep62: Resolved: Listing allies, lists "Plr x" when listing player 
	  x's allies and editing account x (should say "by you"). also when
	  listing allies owned by players other than acct being edited, "Plr
	  x" # is incorrect. (pn is record # in e.t.playerlog, so divide by 2 
	  to get "normal" player #)

6/13/2007
CHANGE	* More intelligent loading of ML.O
	* Better organization of "Combinations" submenu in tep64 editor
	* Changed default "save changes" to "yes"

6/16/2007
INFO	Happy birthday to me! I am $1F years old.

6/23/2007
NEW	Monster quotes file now complete, but for some more choice comments and 
	  typos fixed. (this on the new "installers.d81")
INFO	! flag in monsters file is for quote. \text\tree.txt modified.
	  Modified "monsterenum.04"
CHANGE	Modify order of informational text in "s.tada main 40"
NEW	Started \programming-notes\file-formats.txt

INFO	Optimize the map creation process: read the SEQ desc file, count first 
	  line and number of lines therein, fill in index string as we go along.
	  Write room desc text to records, come back and write index strings to
	  first few records. optimizes 2 passes into 1

NEW	In addition to the RAD SUIT, maybe allow use of LEAD ARMOR
	* Added that to s.t.items, also CANNON and MUSKET and a few other things
	* |xxx* flag indicates ammo carriers and what they go with
	* Expanded to 169 items
INFO	Ammunition items available in Shoppe are items 98 and above
	  (some may be available just in the dungeon)
	* |+ indicates weapon is available in spaceship armory

6/29/2007
FIXED	* if i$="", illegal quantity error in line 2910 (t.main)
	  need to skip uppercase conversion

7/6/2007
NEW	* Make input subroutines in tep* do more work! *whipcrack*
	    They print separator lines, and <RETURN>s before exiting.
FIXED	* Typo in "level 1 room data": "fiery" room
BUG	make level 1 map: if you skip making "e.t.roomindex 1," pass 3 of 2
INFO	Dave Moorman's Input Any doesn't like CHR$(13)...
	  I'll try Jim Butterfield's "Input Any" again.
	  		LDA JIM
			STA HEAVEN
	  Quoted on teh Intarweb! You heard it here first, folks. ;)

7/12/2007
DOCS	File structure organization continues... Separate "file-formats.txt"
	  in \SPUR-data. Removed \text\tree.txt

NEW	\latest-files.txt explains what the latest files are, and where
INFO	\prgs\t.ma.main has proper clock decrement routine
INFO	Seriously considering moving weapon experience to separate file... it
	  sucks for the player to have to choose between 5 weapons to retain
	  experience... just 60 bytes, position #=weapon experience, 0-100

7/15/2007
WIP	Adding screen/printer capability to monsterenum.04 on workdisk-2.d64

7/28/2007
INFO	Having some trouble making changes "stick" to installers.d81.gz;
	  save + verify work and report no errors, but detach/change image and
	  saves are lost. 1) turned off virtual device traps, 2) unzipped
	  disk image into a regular .d81 file, changes now stay changed.
	  (This is only on the laptop, w/7zip and WinRAR installed)
UPDATE	Again, found out *.d??.gz is read-only.
FIXED	Bugs in map information editor (tep79). Still some to squash,
	  shouldn't be hard.
INFO	When using a directory as an IEC device, @CD:.. works to change to
	  parent directory when using JiffyDOS. \text\notes.txt updated.
INFO	Slight bug in "make weapons 1.3": some fields have 5 pieces of info
	  after weapon name. Need to restructure data file/installer to
	  accomodate this (^ as record delimiter).
FUNNY	CHARGE, if you have no horse:
	  (if not in water area) "Clopping two coconut halves against the
		ground does no good here. (You feel a bit dumber)"
	  (if no monster) "Your embarassment is further compounded by there 
		being nothing to charge TOWARDS."
	  (if in water area) "What a concept!"

VeryveryVERY latest version of t.main: installers.d81. Really.
Fixed hourglass, made separate subroutine so can be called from Shoppe, or wherever.
tm%: moves left (should start at 300, defined in t.startup, replacing TR%)

8/17/2007:
FIXED	Ally sick/weak messages. First command no longer gets ignored.
FIXED	Level 1/room 37 special movement case to load "t.bar"

8/20/2007:
BUGS	t.ma.olly lists ammo, but doesn't differentiate between ammo carriers

9/10/2007:
FIXED	RED SONJA! in e.t.allies: records 12 and 21 are duplicates. Changed
	  record #21 to EMMITT "DOC" BROWN, fixed EOWYN in "make allies 1.3" :)

UPDATE	Forget using .gzipped disk images except when archiving.

9/21/2007:
FIXED	Massive reorganization of disk images. Sayonara, deadwood.
	Fixed issue with "make monsters.02": because of INPUT#2 instead of
	  Input Any, was truncating monsters with ":" in attribute lines.
	  There are a few duplicates/typos: PIRANA, SCORPION
NEW	"monsterenum.05" now reads monster quotes

2/23/2008:
CHANGE	"t.prg info" on module-work-disk.d81 now calculates bytes used for 
	  simple/array variables, pauses when done.
FIXED	Prints negative values... now uses ABS()
WISH	Display in hex also

3/2/2008:
NEW	"logic plural" on same; quicker way of displaying ex. "game" or
	  "games"!

03/10/2008:
NEW	"Dusk Approaches" message only displays every fifth turn.
NEW	"t.main 3-10-08" on installers-9-20-07.d81
	(must compare differences, seems like I'm re-doing some things)

05/02/2009:
FIXED	Improved logic in incrementing/decrementing color pairs in "highlight
	  reader"
FIXED	t.stat on module-work-disk.d81 no longer crashes w/RETURN WITHOUT GOSUB

06/07/2009:
FIXED	t.bar now displays/decrements hit points correctly

06/26/2009:
FIXED	e.t.monsters: # of monsters fixed (135), monsterenum.05 no longer reads
	past EOF

08/19/2009:
NEW	Macbeth supplied BASIC decimal -> hexadecimal conversion. Slight
	optimization by me.
CHANGE	Display bytes in hex in "t.prg info"

11/6/2010:
IDEA	Jody: Orange fluffy monster named Gossamer (Daffy Duck would be
	paralyzed with fear).

12/14/2010:
CHANGE	"ally read/reset" can now change the # of allies, since some edit
	process in "tep" trashes it. also reads from current device

3/11/2011:
FIX	gsteemso helped with some math in calculating statistics changing -
		see t.GET.

3/24/2011:
FIX	STAT command properly reflects tiredness mode.
CHANGE	Instead of using GD$(, RC$(, WC$( arrays for guild, race and weapon
	class, slice-'n-dice with MID$() for GD$, RC$, and WC$.
REMOVE	t.main: DIM AL$( CL$( GD$( RC$(
NEW	t.startup: B1/B2/B3 variables (256, 65536, 16777216 respectfully)
		b1=256:b2=b1*b1:b3=b2*b1

5/12/2011:
CHANGE	t.bar:  use CO% instead of NL for deciding which character set to draw
		bar with (NL=# of lines to read from data file)

5/25/2011:
CHANGE	t.np 2: class/race file will give explanation of class/race, Verus' text
		updated accordingly

6/14/2011:
NEW	t.main: 2223 a$="t.bar":goto 1067

7/19/2011:
NEW	t.main: moved ML.O load to 900- range so gets overwritten after loading
			t.startup
FIX		added bounds checking to "teleport function" - mainly debugging
			option for now

C64List:
Converting from .prg to .lbl file results in PETSCII characters in a DOS text file.  
If you have Style's DirMaster utility, here is what I do:

Change the file extension from .lbl to .seq, open with DirMaster. You'll see
tabs and curly braces represented in PETSCII, no worries. Export the file as
.txt, then open the resulting file in your text editor. You will probably have
to trim off the last few bytes (my editor -- EditPad Pro -- has a hex view
mode, very handy for this) </snob>.

2012
====

	5/17
NEW	t.main:		Better flashing cursor GET subroutine from Compute.
				Doesn't leave cursor trails.

	6/6
FIX	t.startup:	RO now recognized as two-byte value with FN L2(226)
				rather than PEEK(226).

NEW	ALL		Working on converting to C64List labels with the
				{include:} function.

IDEA	t_die		Check for clone purchased in Spaceship, maybe 10,000 x
					experience level price.

	12/21 (are we all gonna die?)
IDEA	Level 8		Have the labyrinth entrance & exit point to the
					opposite room (so entering the labyrinth would put the
					player outside the exit) during a full moon or a
					certain spell being cast. There's really no point to
					having the labyrinth anyway, other than frustration.

2013/1/14:
NEW	Using PabloEdit, a network-aware ANSI editor to create a single screen-
	shot of the ANSI main TADA command menu. There are some tweaks that
	should be made (replacing * + ! symbols with p g s, more sensible).

23/Feb/2014 21:39
WIP		Changing {uses:} labels to im.<label> instead of more generic
			sub.<label> in order to tell where the routine is from

March 23, 2014
CHANGE	Applying spell-checking to "s.t.roomdescs 8" - fix "Comforatable"
			and lines 691- need to be re-wrapped.

15/Apr/2014 14:37
IDEA	If player race is Dwarf, then should the Dwarf really be after the
			player's gold?

25/Apr/2014 10:50
FIX		t.stat	Labeling, Honor rating displays as 16-bit instead of 8-bit
				value, reverse Honor ratings to display highest to lowest

28/Jun/2014 14:20
NEW		Global	When prompt ends in ">>", this serves as an indication that
				it is a hotkey. Make sure {:sub.cursor_get} is called.

4/Jul/2015 17:17
NEW		programming-notes/: broke off trace util notes from "modbasic-
			notes.txt" into "trace-util.txt", added small demo program
			in doc.

24/Jul/2015 11:47
CHANGE?	t.main	Check for guild membership once in parser dispatch, then
				take care of interpreting guild commands, instead of checking
				for guild membership where each command is interpreted. May
				not be strictly necessary, since two commands load external
				programs...

CHANGE	t.main	More labels: {:parser}, {:cmd.hourglass} and others

REMOVE	t.main	Dangling GOSUB target removed from {:parser} dispatch routine

31/Jul/2015 23:42
CHANGE		/misc/monsterenum.06.lbl:
				+ fixed {include:} for cursor-get.lbl
				+ corrected "." flag (magic-user monster)

19/Feb/2016 0:16
CHANGE	t.main	{:sub.string_uppercase} - changes a string to UPPERCASE
		{:sub.string_address}(i$) - finds address of a string, returns in v
FIX	t.np	Syntax error in 221 - {:82} unbalanced parentheses

10/Dec/2016 14:42
CHANGE	reader3	'co' tracks # of color combinations instead of 'mx' because
		'mx' also tracked # of text chunks there were in 'e.t.messages'
		index

19/Apr/2017 0:02
CHANGE	global	Clear answer string (usually) before input is accepted, possibly
		also clear quote mode in InString ML before input loop begins
		(eliminates reverse on/off characters displayed when cursor is
		drawn)
