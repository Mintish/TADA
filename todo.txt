	Ernie suggests "restless" flag (perhaps if poisoned)
	"You spend the night tossing and turning, staring at the ceiling..."

		Write a program (for practice?) to mesh the PRG and SEQ data
		instead of doing manually!
	Standardize on modules starting at line 100, 2-99 are subroutines

Hydrophilic:
	As far as attacking Olaf, I imagine he might have a few loyal
	"servants" who would fight with him.  And he would have all the
	"rebels" shackled so they wouldn't be able to help the player.
	So the player would likely meet a quick death unless really leveled
	up.  Or even funnier, Olaf doesn't kill the player but makes them a slave!

agentfriday: what would you think of something like this for calling another module: --->
agentfriday: sys gs,500'inv'

me: oh, the line number, then module?

agentfriday: (yeah, you got it :)
agentfriday: you *could* even move main up to 10000 (or higher) and allocate
agentfriday: a range of 1000 lines for each module. then the module name would
agentfriday: be implied by what line# you are calling. that way, you write
agentfriday: all your code as if you had unlimited memory, and were just
agentfriday: breaking it up into multiple files for the beauty of it :d

me: hmm, guess no reason couldn't move line numbers around. reason some are so
me: odd (1902, 1603, etc) is cuz they were the ones used by image bbs... :p

agentfriday: yeah. seems like they should always work together, right?

me: cm$ looks like it just prevents reloading a module if it was just loaded.
me: and called again.
me: weapon bonuses are going to immediately modify stuff, so not needed if just
me: trying out a weapon in the armory...

agentfriday: yep, that's what i figured

me: maybe i should just stick stats/bonuses in a sub-module, do the module load
me: and go to line 100 (since most sub-modules leave 1-99 for subroutines not in
me: t.main)...

agentfriday: is sub-module a synonym for module?
agentfriday: or are you extending module64 to allow modules to load sub-modules

me: if lm$=ready or lm$=duel then (:bonus)
me: if lm$=armory then (:stats)

	AgentFriday's suggestion: Orcs riding wolves, would affect probability of a battle
	(not sure what this means anymore... i like the idea of orcs riding wolves though.
	Maybe it's just the height differential of a mounted opponent and you being on foot.)

13/Feb/2014 18:20
	Break off individual modules in ML.O into separate {include:} files...
	Benefit would be that "monsterenum" BASIC file would be smaller

Update: I'm not sure this is much of a benefit, ml.o will be BLOADed at $c500,
		not {include:}'d

	write playerlog creator with stock characters to test t.main, since "t.np"
	is broken

	AgentFriday: Possibility of stealing weapons from other players :)
	Maybe one unused bit in the ally abilities slots could be "pilfer"

	- t.main: make {:sub.check.class} and {:sub.check.race} subroutines

	- tep: Implement a "move player record" option

30/Jun/2015 15:41
	- t.say (not written yet, proposed filename):
		if player is not online, send text to PAGE for an offline message?
	- possibility of spliting party up and controlling individual characters
		like "zombies" on MUCKS, can look at different rooms with a command
		prefix like "railbender, go north"
	- magic boots which let you walk across water
	- t.startup: read a system announcement file (new features, etc.)
	- change record size to 254/255 to facilitate creating a character,
		writing to disk properly

1/Jul/2015 9:01
Fixed	- t.main: need to adapt current/last/highlight color addresses to $c500 ML
	- t.np: set map/experience level to 1 (moved from bugs.txt)

gsteemso: game name - "A Spur of Land" :)

- t.prg info: option to toggle trace on/off

some missing module names:
t.bar.bar none
t.bar.zelda
t.bar.djinn

t.encounter (meteor, little girl, etc.)

agentfriday: are you gonna work on the graphics plot exercise?
[23:23:30]
(Me): well, i dunno. could be fun to give TADA a graphical map! but that'd be waaaaaaaay down the road
[23:24:13]
(Me): throw in a split screen or toggle between text/gfx screen with Return or somethin'

when PRAYing, consider if food/drink in inventory is poisoned before saying
"perhaps you should eat or drink something"

19/Nov/2016 23:10
Text editor module should use Jeff Jones' Static Array System to store strings
underneath ROM

Maybe Sliding Input should have an extra .word slot for whether an editor escape code is active (and PREFS command could edit that code). The escape code would be like a dot command in Image BBS, entered on the leftmost column:

Type:	.H

Result:	Command: Help!

Editor dot command strings should be in a separate file, BLOADed in. Static Array System can do a string search.

PRG [<option>]: Optional command-line parameters. "PRG" by itself will display a menu, but {:advent}
		should parse (or at least split "<command> [<argument(s)>]" given, which modules then
		could interpret. Not sure what variables names to use yet. Sleepless nights are good
		for inspiration sometimes, but bad for remembering implementation details.
    PRG D	Toggle debug output: d=peek(v1+<some unused byte, some unused bit, to be determined>)

    PRG T	Toggle trace mode output.
