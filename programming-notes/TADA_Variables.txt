07/20/2004	* Minor formatting changes
08/13/2004	* Added "real" variables + horse saddlebags/race tweak

08/23/2006	* Now use 2-byte BBS ID, longer game name (18 chars)
08/27/2006	* Added "Spur alive?" flag
			* Added "ring worn?" flag
06/17/2007	* Split "Wraith Master" and "Wizard Glow" into two bytes
07/14/2007	* Considering moving v2+167 (weapon experience) to

				inventory items?)

03/29/2009	* Moved monsters killed, adjusted random item storage

03/25/2011	* A few more sanitizations: remove current alignment,
			honor calculates that
03/06/2014	* Player class is now stored as 1-9, not 0-8.

04/15/2014	* Double-spaced listing. Lots easier to read.
		  Added Dwarf gold amount at v2+231 'cause I can't find it
			elsewhere!

08/22/2017	* Clarified "3-byte format" data structure. Putting Spur
			variables next to TADA variables for ease of reference.

			--- Variables in TADA: ---

	"3 byte format" refers to a 24-bit value between 1 - 16,777,216.
	1st byte: # of 65535s, 2nd/3rd byte: hi/lo bytes.
	Handled by t.main using {:get_3_bytes}(x) and {:put_3_bytes}(x).
