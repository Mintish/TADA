This is rendered obsolete by virtue of Input Any now accepting a string parameter.

reader debugging:

so input any grabs 1st variable defined, better make it a string

with modbasic active, if there are any other parameters defined in a subroutine, this can impact what gets displayed, apparently

fn a$ <- okay! displays disk data properly

fn a$,b <- displays "x" (what a$ is defined as at the beginning of the program)

fn b,a$ <- displays properly!

fn b,z$ <- displays "x"

LISTing crashes sometimes w/modBASIC active
my code or AF's?
cold reset, resets or hits BRK maybe

($306/307) LIST points to $a71a, which is standard

($316/317) BRK handler points to $fe66, standard
