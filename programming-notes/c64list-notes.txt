c64list notes:

When no -alpha:xxx command line option is specified, output defaults to -alpha:upper.

agentfriday: The $C1 to $CA range are the correct values

If you want to {use:} a symbol table, can't do:

{asm}
{use:<file>}
{endasm}

in same file. Must do:

{use:<file>}
   |
   +--> <file> contents:
	{asm}
	label = $c000
	{endasm} ---+
                    |
                    v
<back to original file containing {use}>
