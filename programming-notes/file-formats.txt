				ACOS files:

From CiderPress documentation:
DOS High ASCII (TXT)

Apple DOS stores text files with the high bit of every 8-bit byte set.	This 
causes most other operating systems to display characters from an "extended" 
character set (accents, tildes, etc.) instead of the intended characters.  This 
is usually undesirable, so all files from DOS disks with file type 'T' should 
be run through this converter to strip the high bit off.  This will also 
convert the end-of-line character to CRLF.

ALLIES		(record size: 15)
	Ally names/stats.
	0-n:	0=free, >0: Taken by player n
	Name	! after ally name -- TIPS explains this:

		  "Allies with a ! after their names are 'elite' allies. They
		  tend to be more loyal than other allies, have light armor and
		  will not attack you if you refuse to give them food when you
		  EAT or DRINK.)"

		(and does not need to be paid?)

		8/Mar/2016 15:17 Trajan saves my sanity with updated files.

			These seem to be abilities:
		 = [MOUNT]
		 @ [SADDLE]
		 ! [DISCIPLINE] (Elite Ally?)
		 $ [ARMOR]	(better, or light armor?)

SPUR Room Headers						       6/23/06

From Skip:

You may notice some peculiar looking strings after some of the room
names. These begin with the "|" character followed by several other
characters. These were "hidden fields" that triggered some event or
condition in that location. The "|" character as well as the
characters following it were removed before the room name was
displayed to the player. Some come back to me from browsing some
rooms, like "|@@" will be in a water room (i.e. ocean, underground
lake, etc.) You would not be able to enter such a room without a boat
of some kind. Another (if memory serves), would be like "!->" which
indicates a hidden room in that direction (the room would not appear
in the description, but moving in that direction would be possible-
there were often 'subtle' clues in adjacent rooms for such hidden
passages). I noticed numerous others, which I completely forgot
(though looking through the code would hopefully disclose what they
mean).

+	free fire zone (not after |)

Characters after the room name and | indicate the room has certain qualities:

@@	Water
@@!	Water with rocks
@@+x	Water with exit in direction x (x=1-6)

	If there is a number after any of these codes, it indicates direction
	of travel after exiting vehicle (have seen this in water rooms mostly)

		1	North
    		2	South
    		3	East
		4	West

		5-6	up/down?

**	Snow/ice

	@@ and ** rooms also block FLEEing

Things I've discovered:

#!	unknown (seen in level 1 room 157) - statue here?

<<	Blocks spell to go up/down level?
>>	Blocks spell to go up/down level?
		Also blocks FLEEing

->	hidden exit east
<-	hidden exit west
]E]S	Blocks travel in direction after "]"
		Found in room 126 (spur.main:block.s)
	
&	Radiation
&&	Extreme radiation (radiation suit required)

=+	Outer space

~*	Hidden item in room

~*E	Hidden door to the east
~*W	...west
~*S	...south	[~ needs to be translated to ^ in Commodore REL files
~*N	...north		it's CHR$(255) on the Apple]

-	unknown

T	Room transports you (A wave of nausea engulfs you)
	Must be last flag, apparently?

Z-Machine text compression: 5-bit alphabet code ("ZSCII")

http://inform-fiction.org/zmachine/standards/z1point1/sect03.html

Text in memory consists of a sequence of 2-byte words. Each word is divided
into three 5-bit 'Z-characters', plus 1 bit left over, arranged as

   --first byte-------	 --second byte---
   7	6 5 4 3 2  1 0	 7 6 5	4 3 2 1 0
   bit	--first--  --second---	--third--

The bit is set only on the last 2-byte word of the text, and so marks the end.

3.5.3

In Versions 2 to 4, the alphabet table for converting Z-characters into ZSCII character codes is as follows:

   Z-char 6789abcdef0123456789abcdef
current   --------------------------
  A0      abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
  A1      ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
  A2       ^0123456789.,!?_#'"/\-:()
          --------------------------
