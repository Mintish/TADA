dracosilv found an edge case:
if ti/ti$ rolls over, could this produce an infinite wait?
ti is reset along with ti$, i thought it read jiffies since power-up

1 ti$="235900":print ti$,ti:t=ti
2 if ti<t+60 then 2
3 print ti$,ti
4 goto 1
ready.

Setting ti$="235959" lets the bug rear its ugly head. the loop will wait a very, very long time.

be somehow added up to be 60
e.g. try to set ti$="235859"
wait.. wait.. that WILL work.. since.. 23:58:60 is less than 23:59:00
5860 is less than 5900

ha, basic corrected a typo. ti$="235880"... no syntax error
 
hmm

 aah.. its checking values.. and those strings would compare correctly.. so i think the only edge case is basically to a number it can't count to.

this is a two pipe problem (to quote sherlock holmes)

eheh
 
if you could somehow break apart.. or only use the end digits.. it would be easier
e.g. ignore the hours
or minutes.. 
yeah..
and just count that way
so if it went from 59 seconds to 0 seconds.. it would actually go from 59 seconds to 1 minute 0 seconds which would work for all the other times.

well like i said.. unless the time variable is needed.. just reset it to 000000
 
or.. 
store it
reset it to 000000
do your jiffies-test
then add the value of the seconds passed to the time stored... (and make sure to account for overflows.. e.g. 59 to 00 and 23 to 00
easy peasy
