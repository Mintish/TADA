Building TADA:

1) Edit "\scripts\build-main.bat":
	a) Adjust where in your path the C64List 3.03 and casm programs
	   are located.
	b) Re-save.

2) cd \assembly-language
3) casm "ml c500.lbl" -prg -sym:"ml-c500-symbols.lbl" -ovr
	("boot" and "t.main" need symbols from this to work)
4) Run "\scripts\build-main.bat" to compile "t_main.lbl" into "t.main.prg",
   and c1541 puts that on "module-batch-disk.d81" renamed as "t.main".
   When finished, a fresh "\includes\label-assignments.lbl" file is written.
   This needs a bit of hand-editing (no way to automate that yet):
	a) Delete the 3 C64list separator lines starting with "---"
	b) Delete from after {assign:1=1} to before {assign:main_setup=900}
	c) Delete the 3 C64list separator lines starting with "---"

Building TADA disk image:

5) Run "\text-listings\lbl2prg.bat" to compile *.lbl files into *.prg files.
   It uses the "label-assignments.lbl" file created in step 1 to replace labels
   with valid BASIC line numbers throughout the modules.

Another method is to use Peter Schepers' 64COPY utility to copy all *.prg
files into a disk image.

Eventually there will be a "build-disk.bat" batch file which leverages
CALL "add2d64.bat" to automate everything.

Copy all the "make *" installer files too; although these installers are
mostly incomplete, eventually there will be a menu system for them as well,
taking advantage of MODULE64.

Running TADA:

1) Attach the 1581 disk "module-batch-disk.d81".
2) LOAD and RUN the BASIC "boot" PRG file which does the following:

   * "si 9900"		($9900) sliding input routine
   * "modbasic c000 v2" ($c000) AgentFriday's modBASIC extension
   * "ml c500"		($c500) various utility routines
   * "sas c900"		($c900) Jeff Jones' "Static Array System"
   * "trace 033c"	($033c) AgentFriday's BASIC trace routine
   * "wrap.reloc"	($0801) AgentFriday's word-wrap driver
   * "t.main"		($0801) which loads the rest of the code
   * "t.startup"	($0801) startup tasks
   * "t.np"		($0801) new player module

- have a disk image with fresh data (REL/SEQ files) that is copied to the working build disk, delete *.prg and *.log files at the beginning of lbl2prg.bat, add each PRG file to working copy using CALL ADD2D64.BAT as they're built
