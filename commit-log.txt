commit log

	- fixing includes to use absolute paths for Windows build
	- un-indenting ' comments (matter of personal taste)
	- updated SPUR.ANNEX.S to have a more useful player editor, still some unknown things

/assembly-language:
	- re-assemble ml.o to live above modbasic, some adjustments to assemble with c64list

/programming-notes:
	- added modbasic-notes from AgentFriday
	- reformatting TADA_Variables.txt, making some small additions/corrections, double-spacing

/misc:
	- added stack.lbl, should show GOSUB chain

/scripts:
	- new directory, will be moving .bat and .sh (Linux script files) here

/tests:
	- file1.lbl, file2.lbl: testing persistence of {define}d variables (turns out a typo was the culprit)

t.main:
	- continuing to organize related subroutines together (messages, math, adjustments, checks)
	- refined {:sub.log_error}("err_level","module","message")
	- added   {:sub.adj_stat}(statistic,adjustment) for main player
	- bless goog for knowledge of an undocumented c64list command-line switch: -labels :)
	- {include}d check-io-status.lbl, globally changed e% to e

t.np:
	- upgrading to modBASIC
	- Verus now "squints myopically" when asking whether character is male or female

other:
	- new document on Google Drive: BASIC program format <https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1ibQFQ6kIlIpXxJn2YGfFLqfdW2L33CvH_U614SsEVMw/edit?usp=sharing> for friend interested in writing Ruby version of C64List

20/May/2014 11:17
/text-listings/includes:
	- string-setup.lbl: cleaned up code, {uses:} variable-declarations.lbl

21/May/2014 13:31
	- changed "check_io_status" to "check-io-status"

31/May/2014 13:29
/scripts:
	- build-main.bat: Added note to remind user to delete extra C64List output

22/Jun/2014 12:46
/includes:
	- added rel-pointer.lbl
/text-listings:
	- t.main: removed duplicate room desc reading code, working on fixing some
				issues
			- added parameter to {:link.module}("module","label")
				a) "label" can be "" to start at {:1} (which is usually
					"goto 100")
				b) if not "", that module will have a line which directs
					program to proper routine:
						on -(lm$="armory")-2*(lm$="buy") goto {:label1},
						{:label2}
						gosub {:sub.log_error}
					{:sub.log_error} ' ("err_level",line,"message")
			- added fn ln(x)=fn dp(57) <current line #>

- added {ifdef:modbasic} directive to includes, that way small utility programs
	which don't need it don't get "def" stuff included
- moved  {:set.prob} and {:set.pa} from "t_combat-snippets.lbl" to "t_main.lbl"
	to eliminate two duplicate label errors
- renamed {:set.pa} -> {:sub.set_pa}
- renamed {:sub.error_log} -> {:sub.log_error}
- renamed {:sub.event_log} -> {:sub.log_event}
- changed {:subpi} to {:sub.adj_stat} (t.main)

28/Jun/2014 10:53

/installers:
	- changed {$C1...} to proper uppercase letters
	- using more {includes...}, in preparation to use "installerbase v2"
	- fixing some logic

23/Oct/2014 18:15

/text-listings:
	- t.main: changing GOTO {:subroutine}(x,y) to GOSUB {:subroutine}(x,y):RETURN
	- various files: changed "goto {:link.module}" to "gosub {:link.module}"
	- t.startup: changed {:65} to {:search_for_player} (already exists in t.main)
	- t.bar.skip: reworked logic, coffee now clears tired bit
	- various: corrected {:sub.you_feel} to {:msg.you_feel}
/tests:
	- err trap: added missing BASIC code, disassembly of routine
/programming-notes:
	- TADA_Subroutines: Changed duplicate {:file.open} label to {:1027}
*** t.main executes an illegal opcode causing a crash *** -- fixed

4/Dec/2014 12:27
/text-listings:
	- t.np: think I corrected the loop situation when selecting incorrect class/race combo (replaced a few GOSUBs with GOTOs)
		- "Race number [1-9" - only prints ", C", then "]" if c=1
		- changing gender now uses {:bit.flip}
	- t.main: need to adapt current/last/highlight color addresses to $c500 ML

13/Dec/2014 11:44
	- t.main / make playerlog 1.9: changed record length to 236 (2 more than the 234-character player log string length)
	- t.np -- tweaked final line number to be 899 when {def:filler}, 999 otherwise

19/Dec/2014 14:31
	- t.startup: improving birthday routines

28/Dec/2014 16:06
	- fixed order of "input any" params (some had swapped bytes/channel params)
	- fixed {:string.normalize}(an$) call params and t.main subroutine to always return 'an'
	- added {:sub.input_any}(by,ch,cf) subroutine call, t.main subroutine creates local var a$

31/Dec/2014 16:53
	- ml c500.o: Input Any now accepts literals or numeric variables for parameters
	- includes/variable-declarations:
		* br=ml+3, not ia+3 (which=ml), causing spurious module loads, but due to program mode, no error issued. discovered when in immediate mode.
		* force strings to become dynamic (not stored in BASIC program which gets overwritten)
	- includes/rel-pointer.lbl: 'r' is variable for record # if using modbasic, 'x' cannot be both
		a global and local variable simultaneously (type mismatch otherwise)

11/Jan/2015 14:31
	- scripts/build-date_basic.bat: output filename moved to /text-listings/includes, marked 'ignore' in svn
	- scripts/build-main.bat: now calls build-date_basic.bat
	- t.np: {ifdef:module_filler} {number:} condition corrected for closing line 899/999 difference
	- various: regex "([^ ])then" -> "\1 then" adds space between condition and THEN clause (this is an oddity from c64list)
	- includes/bload.lbl: improved error-checking: will report load error or file not found
	- t.main:
		* now loads trace function
		* sub.bload: current device # moved here instead of duplicated 3x for 3 ML loads
	- t.np:
		* on-gosub loop changed to multiple gosubs to play nicely with modbasic

+ added text/menu-40.txt

30/Jul/2015 12:07
text-listings/tests:
	* bits.lbl: {:bit.flip} now just inverts a bit. Messages are printed via
		calling {:sub.item_no_yes}(mem,bit) or {:sub.item_off_on}(mem,bit).
	TODO:	This should be brought into t.main and all calls updated for the sake
		of simplicity.

/programming-notes/memory-map.txt:
	tabs are 8 spaces
scripts/add2d64-test.bat:
	should deal with spaces in paths better now. still doesn't delete existing files in disk images (need a 'basename' function)
text/DISK0025.D64:
	should have complete, uncorrupted "level 1" (before I had The Land of SPUR room desc files) text, but will be level 8 map if I remember correctly.

change old {:bit.flip}("message",mem_loc,bit) 
gosub {:bit.flip}("Guild Follow",v1+64,7)
to
gosub {:bit.flip}(mem_loc,bit):gosub {:sub.item_off_on}(mem_loc,bit)
or
gosub {:bit.flip}(mem_loc,bit):gosub {:sub.item_no_yes}(mem_loc,bit)
