<p> Okay, maybe here: TADA&mdash;short for <i>Totally Awesome Dungeon
Adventure</i>&mdash;aims to be a Commodore 64 re-implementation and
improvement of a game I played on a local Apple // bulletin board
system (BBS) in Tacoma, Washington (state), USA. It ran GBBS Pro
software,&nbsp;modified to reflect the theme of an ancient Roman/Syrian
city called Dura-Europos. The system operator was named after an Roman
emperor of that era, Trajan.</p>
<p> The game which garnered my attention was called <i>The Land of Spur</i>.
The in-game atmosphere was great, despite most room descriptions being
only a few lines long. I remember logging lots of text from it, but I
was never able to get far in it without dying. This frustrated me; I
wanted to know more about the inner workings of the game.</p>
<p> From this a half-formed seed of an idea began... I would re-create
it on my own.
</p>
<p>(Several years ago, Trajan found my web page detailing this project
whilst Googling for "Dura Europos" and got in contact with me on my
BBS! That was really cool. He's set up his system again since then,
working from backup disks. Maybe some day we'll actually get to visit.)</p>
<p> And so TADA began its life as a pile of notes in 8th grade (in
1989) &mdash;many of which I still have, written in faded pencil on the
back
of class notes, envelopes, you name it. Unhappily, no cocktail napkins.
Hey, I was too young to drink at the time. My handle "Pinacolada"
refers to the <i>yogurt</i>, which I still love dearly.</p>
<p> So I started programming little bits and pieces of it, working
mainly from the logs I had accumulated. Along the way, I thought it
would be interesting to add a few features, such as the capability for
the player to add things to the game: rooms, items, and monsters. This
would effectively turn it into a one-player Multi-User Dungeon (SUD?
Single-User Dungeon?).</p>
<p> A few years later I was able to purchase a copy of GBBS Pro at an
ungodly price, along with the Holy Grail (er, programmer's reference
guide) and a magical disk which contained the original version of The
Land Of Spur.</p>
<p> Unfortunately, GBBS Pro did not boot.&nbsp;It was missing the <tt>ACOS.OBJ</tt>
file&mdash;sort of a key element since that is the interpreter for the
script
language the BBS and The Land of Spur were written in, called Advanced
Communications Operating System. Trajan kindly has supplied this file
to me, and another friend from IRC (geneb) provided working disk images
of GBBS Pro.</p>
<p> Back then though, I was stuck. But my mind's eye could reconstruct
what the game could have looked like in its native habitat from reading
the source code. (You'll have to imagine the pick and shovel, little
brushes, and pith helmet of an archaeologist; I've heard many tools of
the trade are rather rough on vintage hardware. Mmm. Vintage. It
doesn't get older, it gets better. Would you care to sniff the power
cord? No... stop... don't <i>lick</i> it! Ack! Well, that's okay; it
wasn't plugged in anyway.)</p>
<p> I've made a hard copy of all the source code and have it backed up
in multiple places now. You shoulda seen the one that got away...</p>
<p> Also, I have PDFs of the BBS manual courtesy of geneb, since my
project to HTMLize it are still in limbo.</p>
<h3> <span style="font-weight: bold;">II. <a name="Features"></a>Features</span></h3>
<p> The Land of Spur has a very team-oriented, cooperative world view,
even though it was just a single-player game (ie, one player would log
on, make their moves, log off, wait for the next player to log on,
etc.) as "was the style at the time" &lt;mental image of hanging an
onion on your belt <span style="font-style: italic;">&agrave; la</span>
an episode of <i>The Simpsons</i>&gt;...</p>
<p> You could also have up to three allies, which could improve your
chances of winning a battle. I'm not sure whether the allies could also
carry things (the version I have doesn't appear to have that
capability) but I've already added it (well, at least the inventory
part so far) in TADA. These could be found whilst adventuring, if your
statistics were "good enough" (I'm still not 100% clear on what merited
this) and you had the option of them joining your party. On the
enhanced Dura-Europos version, you could also re-order the allies'
positions (front, flank and rear guard) to gain tactical advantage.</p>
<p> You could also charm monsters and have <i>them</i> join your
party! Rawr.</p>
<p> There was also a well-done (optional) guild system, in which people
banded together to beat up opposing guilds. Or you could be a civilian,
and have no affiliation with guilds. Or you could be a rogue, and
against everyone! Muhahaha.</p>
<p> You could also have a horse, which would speed up (quoted from the
user documentation) "your journey over the land parts of the Land." It
could also improve your chances of winning a battle (you could <span
 class="command" style="font-family: monospace;">CHARGE</span> into
battle on the first
attack and gain a bonus, especially if you were carrying a lance or
pole weapon). The horse can also carry things, if you find some
saddlebags for it. And it has to be fed and watered, of course.</p>
<p> I'm not sure whether this was done purely by choice of Trajan, but
there were Storm Weapons in the game: intelligent and able to cast
spells.
Pretty neat concept. I'm not quite sure how to implement them yet.</p>
<p> One of the neatest things about the game was that it involved what
I saw as time travel. You could be on the bridge of the <i>Enterprise</i>
with a two-handed sword, or wander around a dungeon level with a
phaser. (Of course this was just the ability to carry items anywhere in
the game, but I like my explanation better!)
</p>
<p>The goal of the game was configurable by the sysop, which usually
involved getting out with:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;"> a) a certain amount of money</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;"> b) a magical item</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;"> c) both a) and b), or</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;"> d) defeating the god Spur, who was a
pretty hard dude to kill, I would imagine. I never did get that far.</p>
<p> Some other interesting features of The Land of Spur were the fact
that&mdash;going back to the guilds concept&mdash;every room in the
game had a
"guild alignment," and you could gain bonuses by having other members
of your guild in the room with you at the time you decided to duel
another character. To gain an easy bonus, you could even pick up
sleeping guild members from other rooms (if the character let you). The
<span class="command" style="font-family: monospace;">FL</span> command
let you turn
that on or off, if you found it annoying that you woke up in a
different room that you bedded down for the night.
</p>
<p>There was also a statistic called "Bad Hombre Rating" (abbreviated
as "BHR") which summarized what that character's fighting
ability was.
</p>
If you belong to a guild, there are guild headquarters located at
various spots on the map, which you can enter if you've paid your
initial Guild dues at the beginning of each month (a wrinkle I will add
at some future date). The payoff is there's usually a stockpile of
gold, weapons, ammunition, and other things for people down on their
luck. It's expected that you leave something in return, and I may
enforce this rule via the software, or at least keep a log of whom
takes what, viewable by anyone in the guild, and leave it up to
vigilante justice to rain down upon the leech from within the ranks
when they become greedy (while watching that player's Honor rating
plummet for attacking members of their own guild :). Both ideas are
equally appealing. The latter is certainly more entertaining, though.<br>
<br>
Speaking of gold: as everyone knows, rivers are some of the richest
places in the world, right? They've got banks on both sides (dodges the
tomatoes).<br>
<br>
While we're on the subject... there can be a problem when that hollow
knot in the old oak tree just isn't <span style="font-style: italic;">big</span>
enough to store all your gains, ill-gotten or no. Plus, carrying them
all around just entices the Dwarf who wanders around in search of
wealthy victims.<span style="" arial="" ;="" font-size:="" 12pt;="">&nbsp;</span><span
 style="" arial="" ;="" font-size:="" 12pt;=""></span>The Merchant's
Annex on Level One is pleased to announce they now have a Guild-owned,
FDIC-insured (Flathead, Dimwit, Idiot and Clodhopper) lending facility
available to the general public.
If you're an evil thief, you may just want to moonlight as a bank
robber. [Inside tip: Let's just say the guards aren't paid very well.
But if some high-powered mage finds you've been skimming gold off his
account... <span style="font-style: italic;">*shrug</span>* don't
say I didn't warn you. You may look <span style="font-style: italic;">cute</span>
with a horse's head.]<br>
<p>If you're <i>not</i> part of a Guild and can stand some
higher-than-average interest rates, visit Vinney at the Wall Bar &amp;
Grill. He's just
your typical underworld mob boss, good (enough) to people who respect
him, not so good to those who don't. Can't pay back a loan on time? No
hard feelings. He'll just send an Invisible Stalker after you, one of
the nastiest creatures in the dungeons, the likes of which most
high-level wizards have trouble with.
</p>
<p>Vinney also has other connections, some of which he'll tell you
about if you merit a certain level of trust. Such as his totally
legitimate, above-board package delivery business.
</p>
<p>(Hmm, I just made the package delivery business up to be funny, but
now that people see it in print they'll expect it in the game... that
would never do. Just not sure how to implement it. I already thought of
Vinney being available for children's parties to be amusing. After all,
the guy no doubt needs <i>some</i> levity in his life, ordering all
these hits and stuff has gotta bring a guy down eventually. I heard him
say he does balloon animals and magic tricks.)</p>

<h3>VII. <a name="Mysteries_abound"></a>Mysteries abound</h3>
<p> I'm still trying to figure out exactly in what way the
programmer encoded room description information on the original disk
images&mdash;I'm using faddenSoft's <span style="font-style: italic;">CiderPress</span>
tool to look at the
information. I do have the full maps (including room description text)
for levels one through six. Level seven has yet to be decoded. But this
makes my job easier, thanks to Trajan. I went ahead and moved my
original level one map to level eight, assuming I'll fill in
information about level seven ("The House") one day.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Update: In the GBBS Pro documentation (I
forget exactly where) it mentions text is compressed as it is written
to disk.
</p>
<p> I finally found an issue of Compute that had a program which
effectively lets you split your BASIC programs into modules, as long as
you keep the main module of the program in memory at all times, which
are lines 1000-, and sub-modules which are lines 1-999&mdash;rather
like
Image BBS's +.files. If there's enough interest, the original intent of
this game was to port it to Image BBS to give it
"single-player/multi-user" capability, but it's obviously important to
get the game working in BASIC first. Maybe I'll flesh out the
"standalone" version to function as a editor and client, allowing the
player to create things offline and upload them to the BBS later. That
would be cool, having user-created maps.</p>

<br>
Developer's Notes:<br>
<br>
Tools I Use:<br>
<p>During the foreseeable future, the ANSI menu will likely be the most
up-to-date; <b>TheDraw</b> (an ANSI art editor) has this awesome block
move feature that makes juggling menu commands a joy.</p>
<p> Rod Gasson's <b>Browser 128</b> is handy for viewing the resulting
work of art on my C128.</p>
<p> <b>EditPad Pro</b> for Windows and Linux has similar features for
plain text files. I can use it to update my ASCII screens too, or use
Craig Bruce's <b>ZED</b> on it.</p>
Having gotten on to IRC a few years ago, I joined channel <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">#c-64</span>, and shortly thereafter, <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">#c64friends</span> for Saturday night
Commodore chat. It's been worth it, forging several long-standing
friendships with folks there.
<p> Recently, between November 2006 and the beginning of 2007, I
managed to write an assembly language INSTRing routine which naturally
operates much more quickly than my BASIC version. There's a slight bug
though; it returns the position of the match in <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">I%</span> just fine, after being
called thusly:</p>
<p style="font-family: monospace;"> 10 SYS49152,"source string","match
string"</p>
<p> but it will return the <i>last </i>position of the match on a
multiple-character match. Whoops! I guess I should be glad it works at
all, assembly numbskull that I am...</p>
<p>Later, on the gone-but-not-forgotten Commodore 128 forum, with help
I got it working perfectly.<br>
</p>
<p> I think rather than trying to code the %-style substitutions in
assembly, I'll try for just a simple SEQ file reader to start, maybe
add word-wrap or paging later on.</p>
<p> What do I mean by %-style substitutions? Gleaned from both DOS
batch files and Internet MUCKs (an undeniably large part of my online
time), they work something like this:

added </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">MORE</span></span><span style=""
 arial="" ;="" font-size:="" 12pt;=""> for controlling
scrolling, hypothesizing this should be separate from Expert Mode.
Except it's not perfect, it doesn't really count lines, it just gets
called after a screen full of text (</span>typically 25 lines) gets
dumped onscreen. I don't have a counter that count words and stuff. I
need a hook into the <span style="font-family: monospace;">PRINT</span>
command, I suppose. </p>
  </li>
  <li>I've thought about&nbsp;<tt><span class="command">PUT &lt;x&gt;
IN &lt;y&gt;</span></tt>
and <span style="font-family: monospace;">TAKE &lt;x&gt; FROM &lt;y&gt;</span>
commands... how else will you put things in saddlebags? <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">GIVE &lt;x&gt; TO HORSE</span> just
sounds kooky, unless you're feeding it.</li>
</ul>
Also, creating objects that can be "scenery"/"hidden",so you can
create&nbsp;<span class="command">LOOK</span>able objects, avoiding
this pitfall (mostly it offends my sense of
style):
<p style="font-family: monospace;"> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Walking
down this wind-swept corridor (owing to the gaping hole in the roof),
you notice several piles of rubble which are neatly swept into conical
piles off to the side of the main thoroughfare.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: monospace;"> You see: RUBBLE, and PILES.</p>
<p> Um... sure gives away the&nbsp;<span class="command">EXAMINE</span>able
items, doesn't it? That's no
fun. (Also, I hope someone can offer critique on my writing style.
People on MUCKs say it's good.) I guess that'd be easy enough to do,
thinking about it. This should use some of the code and reasoning
behind the <span style="font-family: monospace;">HIDE</span> command.
Characters should be able to create scenery objects which may be hidden
(<span style="font-family: monospace;">EXAMINE</span>able or <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">LOOK</span>able as details in the
room), not showing up in the "Objects here are:" line.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, they may have a normal object (a dagger) they
want to hide behind a bookcase. In a wide open area, there may not be
anything to hide an object under/behind/in. Should the room have a
flag/scale for its "hidability"rating? Also maybe places where things
can be hidden: under, behind, etc? Or should that task fall to flags on
the object - supporter (stand or set things on), transparent (look in),
container (put things in)... um, I'd have to look up the rest of the
flags from Graham Nelson's inform6.org site, I really like that site.
You know, I had to Google for "parts of speech" before I could think of
the word "preposition"... Sad.
</p>
<p>I'm thinking <span class="command">SEARCH</span>
would be a better "anti-action" than to enter <span class="command"
 style="font-family: monospace;">HIDE</span> again to find hidden
items. With <span class="command" style="font-family: monospace;">DIG</span>
it makes
sense to use a verb that works both ways, I guess.
</p>
<p>Thieves are good at searching for hidden stuff, of course. And they
have a higher percentage of noticing things "out of the corner of their
eye" if in "plain sight."And you should always be able to find your own
stuff (so it's got to be tagged with who hid it) unless your
Intelligence is &lt;5 let's say, just to throw some arbitrary
restrictions in for laughs. Maybe enter <span class="command"
 style="font-family: monospace;">HIDE BOOKCASE</span> if <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">BOOKCASE</span> is a scenery object. <span
 class="command" style="font-family: monospace;">HIDE</span> would list
all <span style="font-family: monospace;">HIDE</span>able places in
the room and
let you pick. I'm thinking <span style="font-family: monospace;">DIG</span>
and <span style="font-family: monospace;">HIDE</span> should end up
using the same index file as to what's dug or hidden... it wouldn't
make sense to have two files on the off chance that someone had an item
buried AND hidden in the same room...
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Heck, I'd love the whole object tree notion, that of "modern"
text adventure. How to implement it though is another story, at least
for me. Oh, and Z-machine 5-bit ZSCII. Yum. Encryption, and
better-than-nothing compression.</li>
  <li>How about a <span style="font-family: monospace;">LASTON</span>
command to see when your (most/least) favorite character was last awake?</li>
  <li>Whenever an object is <span style="font-family: monospace;">RECYCLE</span>d,
it should go into a Lost and Found area so as to have a "second chance"
at getting it back if you mistakenly <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">RECYCLE</span> something you didn't
want to. Maybe you get ten days or something,until it's irrevocably
destroyed. That thought just popped into my head.</li>
  <li>And there should be a "free object slots" file, probably just a
SEQ file, so the game doesn't have to search from object #1 each time
someone <span style="font-family: monospace;">CREATE</span>s
something. Or better yet, have record #1 of "e.t.objects" contain the
next "free" record. Duh.</li>
  <li>Dang, the Aragain Falls area on Level 1 bugs me. I would like a
"movealong" feature to "push" you through the rooms without giving you
a chance to enter any commands... just be swept away by the water. Of
course, the"entrance" square (forget which room at the moment) should
check to see whether you're carrying the RUBBER DINGHY.. can't
body-surf down it. I know, I spoil everyone's fun.</li>
  <li>Hey, did I ever make sure there's just one exit from each room as
you fall downwards? Oh, maybe calling FLEE code would help? Maybe have
a %- sub, %W, that waits a few seconds, like IMAGE BBS's &pound;W
command?
(In that case, why not have one room with all the lines of the
description of falling downwards? The world may never know.)</li>
  <li>Can't forget Guild dues at the beginning of each month. Have an
autopay plan? Almost mistyped that as "autopsy." :)</li>
  <li>Oratory skills! I finally have a use for the Auditorium. :) You
get to build your skills (by going back there multiple times) in
creating puppet characters, which could conceivably be used for
entertainment, or providing clues to parts of the game. One early
concept was borrowed from Jeeves, a butler (I &nbsp;think he was a
penguin?) on Brazilian Dreams, an online haven that is no more. Would
be real simple:</li>
</ul>
<span class="command" style="font-family: monospace;">SAY JEEVES,
ANSWER PHONE
</span><br>
<span style="font-family: monospace;"> Jeeves reaches into his
tuxedo-plumage and withdraws an old style hand-crank phone. "Hello?" he
squawks into the receiver, cocking his head curiously at the caller on
the other end of the line. "It's for you," he notes, winging the
handset in your direction.</span>
<p> [I'm not sure if you'd actually end up with the phone in your
inventory or not... it'd be kinda funny if you did. :)]<br>
Be pretty simple to implement. Could even be just a SEQ file. Maybe
even have a vocabulary command that lists all the stuff he responds to.
Have operands in the file that mix replies, choosing random ones for
variety. Make him respond to particular characters. Three fictitious
examples:
</p>
<p>(Character is RATH)<br>
<span class="command" style="font-family: monospace;">SAY JEEVES, HELLO</span>
<span style="font-family: monospace;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: monospace;">JEEVES waves enthusiastically
to
his master!</span>
</p>
<p>(Character is ROSE)<br>
<span class="command" style="font-family: monospace;">SAY JEEVES, HELLO</span>
</p>
<p><span style="font-family: monospace;">JEEVES smiles brightly to his
mistress, and kisses her hand. "Good %d, milady."</span>
</p>
<p>[%d may translate into time of day, of which there are six words
used.]
</p>
<p>(Character is ARABELLA, a constant troublemaker in the Brazilian
Bistro)<br>
<span style="font-family: monospace;">SAY JEEVES, HELLO</span>
</p>
<p><span style="font-family: monospace;">JEEVES looks nonplussed, his
feathers ruffled."What do [you] want?" he grouses, the last inkling of
civility hiding somewhere between his feet, making the normally jovial
Emperor penguin seem cold and distant. But perhaps that's just a case
of nature vs. nurture.</span>
</p>
<p><span style="font-family: monospace;"><span class="command">ORDER
HAM AND EGGS</span></span><br>
(This brings to mind the idea of characters creating actions other than
those listed on any of the menus. In this case I'd assume there was a <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">READ MENU</span> option available, and
<span style="font-family: monospace;">ORDER</span>ing something costs
money - perhaps doubly so if you're a troublemaker...)-- oops, wait, <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">ORDER</span> conflicts with the
command used to re-arrange allies' tactical positions... <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">PURCHASE</span>, instead? <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">BUY</span>. Even better, shorter on
the ol' fingerbones.
</p>
<p><span style="font-family: monospace;">JEEVES scowls, moving behind
the oak-topped bar. "%N, my master has
commanded me to be polite to his friends, but I do not feel you fall
into that category. Here's your slop. Now we have a really great
shoo..." You get the feeling he's not [exactly] quoting Ed Sulivan,
before he starts whapping you with his wings. "Beat it before I bite
you!"</span>
</p>
<p>It would be interesting to see whether puppet characters can give
you real items; perhaps they can use a separate index file, a smaller
one... An old man could give you a scroll with instructions for a
quest, Jeeves above could wander off to another room when he gets tired
of incessant actions,maybe even bring reinforcements ;) Probably be too
hard to code though. It'd be hilarious if Jeeves poisoned the ham and
eggs :)</p>
<p> Castle password, how's someone going to get that, and what's the
goal of getting <span style="font-style: italic;">into</span> the
castle? So far it's just a boring place.
Think, McFly, think...
</p>
<p>Well, geez, I'm bright, the solution to the "why Vinney vs the
bank? Aren't they redundant?" question has been staring me in the
face... because the bank <span style="font-style: italic;">only</span>
caters to members of guilds! <span style="font-style: italic;">How</span>
long ago
did I write that?Another case of "can't see the forest for the trees."
</p>
<p>Note to self: Self, considering the amount of work you have yet to
do,let's not keep adding work, hmm? Okay, I guess I don't have to have <i>every</i>
single feature for this release...</p>
<p> Haw haw. And I thought coding a file reader would be easy. I've <b>just
about</b> licked the %-sub problem. Chatted with FuzzyFox (he wrote
AutoGraph) and he wondered why I doing DEYs all over the place...</p>
<p> I have this coded in BASIC already, mind you. It knows to look up
variables and such, whereas the ML routine...
</p>
<ul>
  <li>doesn't, and goes off into lala land when it loses its place in
the string. Solution? I'm sure it's to use a location other than <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">$FB</span>-<span
 style="font-family: monospace;">$FF</span>. <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">LDA #$INDEX</span> or some such.</li>
  <li>FuzzyFox mentioned some routine that I was using clobbers one of
those locations, or the Y register or something. I need to look at the
chat log again. </li>
  <li>is too hard-coded - it needs to know about BASIC variables. Thank
goodness for an issue (not sure which one) of Loadstar's BITS columns,
where Mike Maynard discusses how to retrieve values of strings in BASIC
from ML. I bet you a plugged nickel this is the same routine the <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">VARPTR</span> routine I'm using is
based on... So if I'd just sit down and try coding a bit... :)</li>
</ul>
Ooh! Ooh! Here's an idea:<br>
<br>
%!p (the opposite gender for those flirtatious monster[ette]s)&nbsp;
<p>or maybe just %P (capital) to make it easier to parse... dunno. I
like the !'s usefulness in signifying <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">NOT</span>. Of course this will make
sense only with certain substitutions.</p>
<p style="font-family: monospace;"> The %m flutters %p eyelashes at
you."Gosh, er, hi, %N!"</p>
<p style="font-family: monospace;"> The GNOME flutters her eyelashes at
you."Gosh, er, hi, RATH!"</p>
<p> Waitasec, what am I thinking... too tired... %p should get set to
the gender of the calling object... shouldn't it? How about making
&pound;
(the British pound sign) interchangeable with %? Or instead adds More
Neat Stuff(tm)? Dubious. End of transmission.</p>
