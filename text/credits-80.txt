   Based on THE LAND OF SPUR (1986-1994), last seen running on Dura-Europos.
   Here's lookin' at one of the best Apple BBS text adventures in existence
   today, or any day. The game was a true classic, and the inspiration behind
   this adaptation and enhancement. Thank you for making adventurers happy.

    Oh, yes -- Verus, your locum is doing very well here.

	Then there's the undeniable influence from MUCKs...  Feeps 4-ever!
