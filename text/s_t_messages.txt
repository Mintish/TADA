# 1 - new player intro - 17 lines
Approaching a wrought iron gate, you
notice a wizened old man waiting for
you. He is swatting flies and munching
on a date. He introduces himself as
Verus.

"Ah," he says happily, "a new champion!
Well, I suppose we should get you fixed
up. Follow me, please!" His blue eyes
twinkle merrily -- no doubt thinking of
his recruitment bonus -- as he gestures
towards a wooden building. Taking
another slap at the pesky black flies,
the two of you are on your way.

Verus begins asking you some questions
as you travel towards the building.

# 2 - new player age - 13 lines
"How old be ye?" asks Verus.

(NOTE: Age is considered to be in real
time - i.e., you have a birthday every
real-world year. [If] you live that long,
of course...)

* [0] chooses an undetermined age.
  Players EXAMINEing you are told they
  can't tell $n's age.

* [R] chooses a random age between 15
  and 50.

# 3 - new player guild - 20 lines
You may start out as a Civilian, Guild
member, or an Outlaw.

* [Civilians] are safe from being DUELed
  by other players, but neither may they
  start a duel. Later, you may wish to
  join a Guild. (This is recommended for
  first-time players.)

* [Guild members] earn certain advantages
  within the game, and can attack
  members of opposing Guilds without
  incurring monetary, Honor or other
  penalties.

  There are three Guilds: Fist, Sword
  and Claw.

* [Outlaws] are free to attack members of
  any Guild, except Civilians.

# 4 - new player quote - 14 lines
Now enter a quote which you want your
character to say to passers-by in the
dungeon.

You may choose to "be silent" if you
just hit [Return].

[QUOte] in the dungeon views or changes
$n's quote.

Note that [$$n] in the quote is replaced
with the name of whoever is reading it.
(Don't forget a space or comma after
$$n.)
^
# 5 - new player description - 20 lines
"I'm going to give you a scroll upon
which to write a description others see
when they [EXAMINE $n]," says Verus.

  At the beginning of a line in the text
  editor:

* [.S] saves your description.

* [.A] aborts changes (after confirming).

  If you have no description available,
  EXAMINEing players get only a general
  description based on stats.

* [DESc] in the dungeon views or changes
  this description.

You have twenty lines of text available
for use at 40 characters per line.

# 6 - new player post-creation info - 2 lines
Standby. Finding your place in the
universe...
^
# 7 - new player challenge - 31 lines
SPUR, the almighty and omnipotent,
senses your intrusion into his land!
"Thou dost dare to enter [my] domain?! I
await thee at the appointed site!"

Verus glances up at the clap of thunder
from above and shakes his head
disparagingly. "Don't mind him, he's in
one of his moods again..."

He lightly punches you on the shoulder,
bony knuckles making you wince inwardly.
Verus' gaunt face is alight in a nearly
toothless smile, and he murmurs, "Go
show 'im, kid - for me, and for all the
rest of us..."

Verus walks with you down a dirt path
towards the wooden building you had
noticed before. This is the Merchant's
Annex, a place of rest and procuring
supplies.

Welcome to the Land. May your travels
be nigh overly fraught with peril, and
always richly rewarding. There is much
to explore and learn. Good journey to
you.

Overhead, a bright blue sky promises a
return to what once was...
