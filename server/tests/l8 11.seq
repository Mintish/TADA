^ÈERE TOO, SKELETONS ARE SITTING ONROUGH BENCHES NEXT TO THE TABLES.ÐLATES OF UNAPPEALING-LOOKING FOOD LIENEXT TO A SWORD THAT IS PERMANENTLYSTUCK IN THE TABLE AT A RAKISH ANGLE,ALMOST UP TO ITS HILT. ÍUDDY RODENTTRACKS LEAD TO A SMALL CRACK IN THHHESOUTHWEST CORNER. ÂONES AND ROTTEN FOODLITTER THE FLOOR. Á SHATTERED WINEGLASS LIES NEXT TO A YELLOWED PACK OFCARDS.^ÆURNISHINGS HERE ARE THREADBARE ANDWORN, BUT LOOK AS IF THEY USED TO BE INGOOD SHAPE AND WELL MADE. Á GIANTFOUR-POSTER CANOPY BED IS THE MOSTIMPRESSIVE WORK OF CARPENTRY YOU'VESEEN TO DATE. ÉNTRICATE SCROLLWORKADORNS THE BED, AND EVEN THOUGH TIME HAS OBSCURED MANY DETAILS, YOU CAN STILLMAKE OUT SEVERAL BAS-RELIEF FIGURESWHICH HOLD UP THE CANOPY.^ÔHE VIEW FROM HERE IS MAGNIFICENT: YOUCAN SEE THE WHOLE FOREST AND THEMOUNTAINS WHICH ARE BATHED IN A GENTLEPINK AND YELLOW GLOW OF THE SETTINGSUN. ÔO THE SOUTH ARE SOME STAIRS WHICHLEAD DOWN.^ÙOU ARE IN THE NORTHEAST CORNER OF THEABANDONED TOWER. Á LOUD AND STEADYDRIPPING NOISE CAN BE HEARD, AND YOUCAN SMELL THE FAINT CLOYING ODOR OFVANILLA.^ÙOU LOOK DOWN ON LUSH GREEN AND BROWNSQUARES OF LAND, JUST BARELY VISIBLEFROM THIS HEIGHT. ÔHE FLOOD BASINCERTAINLY HAS BLESSED THE LAND WITHFERTILITY.^ÙOU ARE CLIMBING A SET OF ROUGHLYCARVED STONE STEPS. Á VAST PRECIPICEWITH A WONDERFUL VIEW OF THE VALLEYBELOW IS TO YOUR WEST, AND ÅTTINSMOORLIES TO YOUR EAST.^ÔHIS LONELY MOOR IS SITUATED TO THENORTH OF ×ATERSMEET. ÉT IS RUMORED THATWITCHES AND HAGS USE THE AREA FOR THEIRSECRET CEREMONIES ON CLEAR NIGHTS WHENTHE MOON IS FULL. Á BRISK WIND BLOWSOFF THE SURFACE OF THE MURKY WATERS,CHILLING YOU MOMENTARILY. ÇAUNT TREESBENT ALMOST DOUBLE FROM THE BLASTREMIND YOU OF TORTURED SOULS PRAYINGFOR MERCY IN THE HANDS OF CRUEL ANDTORTUROUS CAPTORS. ÔO THE WEST LIES ASET OF GIANT STONE STEPS THAT LEADUPWARD.^ÔHIS IS A PLEASANTLY QUIET PLACE. ÁBIRCH TREE WITH LARGE ROOTS INVITESCOMFORTABLE REPOSE AGAINST THE SMOOTHBARK. ÌONG GREEN GRASS BEGS YOU TOREMOVE YOUR SHOES AND FROLIC IN THESOFTNESS FOR BUT A MOMENT..^ÔHIS GLEN IS FILLED WITH BUSHY PINETREES. ÔHEIR NEEDLES SNAP AND CRUNCHWHEN YOU STEP ON THEM, AND THE AIRSEEMS VERY DRY. ÔHE DRONING HUM OFINSECTS MAKES YOU SLIGHTLY DROWSY.^ÔHE PATH WIDENS MOMENTARILY HERE; TREESARE GROWING IN A ROUGH SEMICIRCLEAROUND THE EDGES OF THE PATH. ÙOU HAVESOME BREATHING ROOM AT LAST, AND THESUN SHINES BRIGHTLY DOWN.
