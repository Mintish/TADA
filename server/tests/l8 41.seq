^Á STAND OF POPLAR TREES BLOCKS YOUR WAYTO THE SOUTH. Á SQUAT STUMP IS IN THEMIDDLE OF THE RING OF TREES; IT HASFUNGUS GROWING ON IT AND FLABBY WHITEWILD MUSHROOMS GROWING OFF THE TOP OFIT.^ÔHIS PATH IS LINED WITH COARSE GRAVELAND LOOKING UP YOU NOTICE A THICKLYINTERWOVEN CANOPY OF BRANCHES ANDLEAVES OVERHEAD WHICH PROVIDESPLEASANTLY COOL SHADE FROM THE SUN.^ÇROUPS OF WIND-SWEPT TREES REMIND YOUOF OLD WOMEN HUDDLED TOGETHERGOSSIPING. ÔHERE ARE TREES WHICH YOUCANNOT IDENTIFY, AND YOU SURMISE THATTHEY MUST HAVE BEEN TRANSPLANTED FROMÁRCHENLAND OR PERHAPS ÁLFHEIM.^ÒOWS OF LOGS, BOTH THICK AND THIN, LIELASHED TOGETHER USING STOUT CORD INNEAT PILES ALONGSIDE THE RUTTED ROADTHROUGH THE TREES. ×IDE OPEN SPACES AREBECOMING MORE COMMON AS THE PUSH FORCOLONIZATION INCREASES AND LOGGINGACTIVITY INCREASES. ÈAPPILY, THOUGH,MOST LOGGERS REPLANT TWO TREES FOR EACHONE THEY CUT DOWN.^ÔHIS SOLEMN-LOOKING PLACE IS MOSTLYGENTLY ROLLING HILLS COVERED WITH DRIEDGRASS. ÔO THE EAST IS A SHEER ROCKFACE, THE TOP OF WHICH CANNOT BE SEEN.ÃRUDE HANDHOLDS MAY MAKE PASSAGEUPWARDS POSSIBLE.^ÙOU THROW YOURSELF UPON THE TOP OF THEROCK FACE, PANTING WITH EXERTION. ÁGIANT NEST, MADE OF VARIOUS SIZES OFTWIGS AND SMALL TREE BRANCHES SCAVENGEDFROM THE FOREST FLOOR TAKES UP MOST OFTHE AREA HERE. ÁT FIRST GLANCE, ITAPPEARS THAT TWO SMALL STONE STATUESAND A LARGER STATUE ARE CURRENTLYOCCUPYING THIS NEST.^ÔHE WIND WHISTLES FIERCELY THROUGH THISROOM, THE REASON BEING THERE IS LITTLELEFT OF THE SOUTHWEST WALL TO PREVENTIT FROM DOING SO. Á TREE MUST HAVEFALLEN DOWN UPON IT IN A TERRIBLEWINDSTORM YEARS AGO. ÔHE EAST WALLHOLDS WHAT REMAINS OF A SMALLBOOKSHELF. (ÄESCRIPTION: ÔHERE ARE MANYPAGES ON THE FLOOR THAT HAVE BEEN BLOWNFROM BETWEEN THE COVERS OF THE BOOKS.ÈOWEVER, THERE IS ONE BOOK THAT ISALMOST COMPLETELY INTACT, AND ITAPPEARS TO BE STILL FIRMLY LODGED INTHE BOOKCASE.)^ÔHIS PASSAGE HAS NOT BEEN USED INYEARS. ÙOU CAN SEE A VERY DIM LIGHT TOTHE EAST. ÔHE WALLS LOOK WEAK BACKHERE, AND LARGE WOODEN TIMBERS SERVE ASBRACES SO THEY DON'T FALL DOWN.^ÔHERE ARE BOXES AND BOXES OF DUSTYGLASS AND CRYSTAL BOTTLES WITH TWIRLYWRITING ON THEM. ÔRUNKS FILLED WITHFAINTLY SCENTED CLOTHS IN FADED COLORSAND CHIPPED BEAKERS AND FLEXIBLE TUBINGAND FUNNELS AND OTHER THINGS YOU CANNOTFIND THE WORDS TO DESCRIBE FILL THISANCIENT ROOM. ÐERHAPS IT WAS AN ALCHEMYLABORATORY IN EARLIER TIMES?^Á LARGE STATUE OF A WOMAN DOMINTATESTHE CENTER OF THIS ROOM. ÓHE IS SMILINGBEATIFICALLY, AND SEEMS TO BE OFFERINGYOU SOMETHING IN HER OUTSTRETCHEDHANDS.^
