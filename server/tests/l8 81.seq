^ÔHE BRIDGE IS BROKEN IN HALF. ÔOWARDSTHE WEST YOU CAN SEE A VAST UNDERGROUNDRIVER. ÙOU CAN STILL TURN BACK THE WAYYOU CAME TOWARDS THE EAST.^ÔHESE CAVERNS ARE QUITE LARGE, THECEILING IS LOST IN THE SHADOWS ABOVEYOUR HEAD.^ÖOLCANIC AND SEISMIC ACTIVITY HASTHRUST THE GROUND UP INTO HUNDREDS OFCHUNKS. ÃRACKLING OF FIRE UNDERNEATHYOUR FEET AND SMOKING HOLES IN THEGROUND MAKE THIS AREA DANGEROUS.^ÙOU HAVE STUMBLED INTO AN OGRE'S LAIR.ÅACH CHAMBER IN THIS CAVERN COMPLEX ISLIT BY A CRUDE, SMOKING TORCH. ÔHE DIM,FLICKERING ILLUMINATION REVEALS BURIALCHAMBERS, LITTERED WITH OLD BONES,SKULLS, AND ROTTING SHROUDS. ÙOU HEAR AFIERCE GRATING ROAR! ÐREPARE TO DOBATTLE!^ÙOU ARE IN THE CROWN OF A TALL OAKTREE. ÔO THE NORTH YOU CAN SEE THEÍERCHANT'S ÁNNEX. ÔO THE EAST YOU CANSEE A HILLTOP. ÔO THE SOUTH YOU CAN SEEA LAKE AND MOUNTAIN.^ÙOU ARE ON A LONELY, NARROW, DARK PATH.ÔREASURES, PERILS, AND MYSTERIES AWAITTHE ADVENTURESOME.^ÙOU ARE STANDING ON A DOCK WHICHEXTENDS TOWARDS THE EAST.^Á SMALL LAKE STRETCHES OUT BEFORE YOUTO THE EAST. ÁNOTHER DOCK CAN BE SEENDOWN THAT WAY AS WELL.^ÙOU GET OUT OF YOUR DINGY, MOOR IT ONTHE DOCK, AND KNOCK AT THE DOOR OF THISHOUSE... ÒECEIVING NO REPLY, YOU TRYTHE DOOR. ÆINDING IT UNLOCKED, YOUDECIDE TO COME IN AND POKE AROUND ALITTLE, BEING AN ADVENTURER. ÓO NOW YOUARE STANDING IN THE FRONT ROOM. ÔHEREARE SOME STAIRS WHICH GO DOWN TOWARDSTHE EAST, AND ANOTHER ROOM TOWARDS THEEAST. ÓOME STAIRS THAT GO UP TOWARDSTHE SOUTH ARE HERE TOO, TRYING HARD NOTTO BE NOTICED BUT IN DOING SOPRACTICALLY SCREAM "ÃLIMB ME!"^
