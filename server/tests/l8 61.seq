^ÔHIS LOOKS LIKE A LIKELY SPOT TO PULLIN. ÔHE WATER IS CALM AND UNHURRIED,THERE'S NO CHANCE OF THE DINGY BEINGSWEPT OUT TO THE RIVER AGAIN ONCE YOUBEACH IT. Á MEANDERING PATH THAT SNAKESBETWEEN TWO STATELY ELMS CAN BE SEEN TOTHE SOUTH.^ÙOU ARE IN THE ÍERCHANT'S ÁNNEX.^Á PATH LEADS DOWN INTO THE GROUND TOTHE WEST, AND OTHER PATHS LEAD OFF TOTHE NORTH, EAST AND SOUTH.^ÔO THE SOUTH IS A GRAND VIEW OF THEWATERFRONT DISTRICT; A NICE DOCK CAN BESEEN DOWN THAT WAY..^Á MAGNIFICENT LAKE IS TO THE SOUTH, YOUCAN SEE IT OVER THE SLIGHT RISE IN THELAND. ÉT LOOKS VERY COOL ANDREFRESHING.^ÙOUR PATH TAKES A SUDDEN ZIG-ZAG ROUTEAS THE GRADE OF THE HILL INCREASESSHARPLY. ÌUCKILY, THE ROAD ISHARD-PACKED DIRT AND NOT SLIPPERYGRAVEL. ÙOU FIGHT YOUR WAY TO THE TOPOF THE HILL AND TURN FOR A MOMENT TOSURVEY YOUR SURROUNDINGS. ÈIGH IN THESKY CIRCLES A LONE EAGLE, AND FOR AMOMENT IT IS AS IF YOU ARE THE ONLY TWOBEINGS IN THE WORLD. ÙOU TURN AWAY, ANDWITH RENEWED SPIRIT CONTINUE ON YOURWAY.^ÙOUR WAY IS PARTIALLY BLOCKED BY A ROCKPILE THAT HAS BURIED SOME HAPLESSADVENTURER. Á SKELETAL HAND IS STICKINGOUT OF THE ROCKS STILL CLUTCHING AUSELESS RUSTY SWORD.^ÈIGH SANDSTONE WALLS SURROUND YOU,BLOCKING THE SUN'S WARMTH. ÆAINT TRACESOF ANCIENT ROCK PAINTINGS CATCH YOUREYE. ÌOOKING MORE CLOSELY, THE IMAGE OFA BEAR TAKES FORM.^ÔHE CANYON TAKES A SHARP TURN HERE TOTHE WEST. ÔHE CANYON FLOOR IS FAIRLYSMOOTH AND EASY TO TRAVEL ON.^ÙOU STAND ON THE EDGE OF A DRY MOAT INFRONT OF A RUN-DOWN CASTLE. ÔHEDRAWBRIDGE IS CLOSED. ÁN UNEARTHLYVOICE WHISPERS FAINTLY, "×HAT IS THEPASSWORD?" AND FADES AWAY TO BEREPLACED BY THE STEADY YET UNOBTRUSIVE(ALMOST PLEASANT) CHIRPING OF CRICKETS.^
