^ÙOU ARE AT THE MIDDLE OF A LARGE NARROWHALLWAY WHICH IS FILLED WITH REMARKABLYLIFELIKE SCULPTURES OF MEN AND BEASTS.ÐAINTINGS OF THE FOREST, STRANGELYDISTORTED YET ODDLY VIVID, LINE THEWALLS.^ÔHIS USED TO BE ÍANANAN'S WAITING ROOMFOR MAGICAL CONSULTATION AMONG HISCOLLEAGUES; CHAIRS HERE HAVE SEEN MUCHUSE. ÐICTURES ON THE BACK WALL SEEM TOMOVE WHEN YOU ARE NOT LOOKING DIRECTLYAT THEM.^ÈERE A PALE GREENISH LIGHT EMANATESFROM NOWHERE IN PARTICULAR AND THE DESKAND WALLS ARE COVERED WITH ARCANESYMBOLS AND SPOOKY MAGICAL STUFF THATNO DOUBT MAINTAINED ÍANANAN'S IMAGE BUTDON'T IMPRESS YOU. ÍUCH.^ÔHE HUMID AIR IN HERE MAKES YOU SWEAT ALOT. ÐEERING DOWN A HOLE THAT IS IN THEMIDDLE OF THE FLOOR, YOU ARE HIT IN THEFACE BY A BLAST OF STEAM.  ÆAINTBUBBLING AND COOKING-POPPING NOISESCOME FROM DOWN BELOW. ÔHE STRONG SMELLOF SULPHUR DOES NOTHING TO IMPROVE THEGENERAL STATE OF THINGS.^ÔHE SPACIOUS GUEST LODGINGS SOGRACIOUSLY PROVIDED BY YOUR HOSTSACTUALLY TURN OUT TO BE NOT THAT BAD.ÓILKEN PILLOWS HELP CALM YOUR JANGLEDNERVES AS YOU SINK DOWN INTO THEM. ÁSIZEABLE HOLE HAS BEEN CUT IN THECEILING, AND IT IS OPEN TO THE SKY. ÁNET HAS BEEN ATTACHED TO PREVENT SMALLANIMALS AND DEBRIS FROM FALLING DOWNONTO PEOPLE'S HEADS. ÔHE ÅAST ÑUARTERSARE TO (WHERE ELSE?) THE EAST.^ÃOMFORATABLE FUTON BEDS AND A SMALL YETUSEFUL WRITING DESK OCCUPY THIS WING.ÓEVERAL TASTEFUL AND MODERATELYHANDSOME SECT MASKS ADORN THE SIMPLEWALLS. ÔHEY HAVE PLEASANT SMILES, ANDINVITE A RESTFUL NIGHT'S SLEEP.^ÉN THE CENTER OF THE WALL OPPOSITE THEENTRANCE TO THIS LARGE ROOM IS A CARVEDWOODEN FACE THAT THAT FILLS THE AREAFROM FLOOR TO CEILING.  ÔHE CARVING ISHIGHLY POLISHED, AND FLASHES WITHREFLECTIONS OF LIGHT. ÔHE MOUTH ISSLIGHTLY OPEN, AND THE EYES SEEM TOGLARE AT YOU FOR A SPLIT SECOND, THENTHE EXPRESSION SOFTENS. ÉN THE CENTEROF THE ROOM SITS A PEDESTAL WITH APERFECTLY PRESERVED STUFFED OROTHERWISE IMMOBILIZED HUMMINGBIRD.^ÔHIS NARROW STRIP OF LAND IS COVEREDWITH EVERY IMAGINABLE KIND OF PEBBLEKNOWN IN CREATION. ÌITTLE ONES, BIGONES, SHINY ONES, DULL ONES, ROUNDONES, SQUARE ONES... WELL, YOU GET THEIDEA. ÔHERE ARE LOTS OF PEBBLES HERE.ÔO THE NORTH IS THE WATER, TO THE SOUTHIS A DEEP SMOKING CRACK IN THE EARTH.^Á TWISTING, TURNING TRAIL LEADS UPWARDSTO THE SOUTH AND DOWN TOWARDS THE EAST.^Á TWISTING, TURNING TRAIL LEADS UPWARDSTO THE WEST AND DOWN AND SOUTH TOWARDS×ATERSMEET.^
