^ÙOU ARE WANDERING AIMLESSLY AROUND INTHE ÆOREST OF ÃANOLBARTH. ÔHIS APPEARSTO BE AS FAR NORTHWEST AS YOU CANPROCEED.^ÔHERE APPEARS TO BE EVIDENCE OF SOMELOGGING IN THIS AREA; THERE ARE DEEPRUTS IN THE SOFT GROUND. ÔHERE ARE MANYTREE STUMPS, MORE STUMPS THAN THERE AREWHOLE TREES. ÔHE TREES THAT REMAIN HERESEEM TO BE EITHER DEAD OR DYING.^ÓEVERAL OF THE SHORTER TREES HEREAPPEAR TO BE MUTILATED AND HORRIBLYTWISTED. ×HETHER THEY WERE VICTIMS OFDISEASE OR INTENTIONAL ABUSE, YOU MAYNEVER KNOW.^Á FEW SCATTERED TREES HERE BEAR TOOTHMARKS ON THE LOWER PART OF THEIR TRUNKSAND GNAWED BARK HANGS DOWN IN LARGEROUGH STRIPS. Á GIANT OAK TREE WHICHSTANDS DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF YOU HASBEEN BLACKENED; MOST LIKELY, FROM ALIGHTNING STRIKE. ÔHE LEAVES ARE GONEAND THE TREE ITSELF IS CRACKED INTOTHREE PIECES.^ÙOU ARE STANDING AT THE BASE OF AMAJESTIC OAK TREE THAT TOWERS MANY FEETABOVE YOU. ÔHE FOLIAGE IS QUITE DENSEAND YOU CANNOT SEE VERY FAR UP INTO THETREE. Á SERIES OF RICKETY WOODEN PLANKSIS CLUMSILY NAILED TO THE SIDE OF THETREE, ALLOWING PASSAGE TO THE CROWN OFTHE TREE.^ÔHERE IS A ROUGH PATH THROUGH THEMIDDLE OF THIS ROOM, AND ALONG THE PATHAT INTERVALS STAND RICHLY DECORATEDSUITS OF ARMOR, LIKE KNIGHTS GUARDINGTHE TREASURE. ÉN BETWEEN THE SUITS OFARMOR ON EITHER SIDE OF THE PATH ARESHELVES COVERED WITH PRECIOUS BAUBLES:NECKLACES, CHALICES, RINGS, GOLDENBOWLS, LONG TUSKS OF IVORY AND GOLD;BROOCHES, AMULETS, AND CHAINS OF SILVERAND PLATINUM; HEAPS OF UNSET STONESLYING IN GREAT PILES AS IF THEY WEREMARBLES - DIAMONDS, RUBIES, CARBUNCLES,TOPAZES AND AMETHYSTS. ÁND UNDERNEATHTHE SHELVES ARE LARGE CHESTS OF OAKSTRENGTHENED WITH IRON AND HEAVILYPADLOCKED. ÅVERYTHING HAS A THIN LAYEROF DUST ON IT, AND THERE IS AN AIR OFSADNESS AND GLOOM ABOUT THE PLACE.^ÔHE WALLS IN THIS ROOM ARE FILLED WITHSHELVES WHICH ARE FILLED WITH BOOKSWITH SUCH STRANGE NAMES AS "ÔHE ÌIFEAND ÌETTERS OF ÓILENUS" OR "ÎYMPHS ANDÔHEIR ×AYS" OR "ÍEN, ÍONKS, ANDÇAME-ËEEPERS: Á ÓTUDY ÉN ÐOPULARÌEGEND." ÔHERE ARE NUMEROUS CHAIRSSCATTERED AROUND THE ROOM WHICH LOOK ASIF THEY USED TO BE EXTREMELY INVITINGAND COMFORTABLE. ÏIL LAMPS LOOK AS IFTHEY PROVIDED PLEASANT IF NOT ADEQUATEREADING LIGHT. Á DESK IN THE MIDDLE OFTHE ROOM IS COVERED WITH DUSTY,COMPLICATED-LOOKING MAGICAL MACHINERYAND ANCIENT SYMBOLS. ÔHE STUFF LOOKS SODANGEROUS, AND THE RUNES SO FORBIDDING,THAT YOU HESITATE TO GO NEAR ANY OF IT.^ÆLOOR TO CEILING SHELVES HOLD MANYYELLOWING BOXES AND CRUMBLING WOODENBARRELS OF FOOD. ÍANY DIFFERENT SHAPESOF PACKAGES DONE UP WITH FRAYED CORDARE ON THE SHELVES, AND SMALLGREASE-STAINED BAGS OF UNKNOWN ORIGINFILL THE CRACKS UP.^ÒUSTY POTS AND PANS HANG FROM HOOKS ONTHE STONE WALL. Á WOOD STOVE USED FORCOOKING IS THICKLY COVERED IN COBWEBSAND IS QUICKLY FALLING TO DISREPAIR.ÌARGE DUSTY COUNTERS STILL HOLD THEIRCOLLECTIONS OF OLD KITCHEN UTENSILS ANDROTTING MEATS. Á GREAT STONE FIREPLACEIS IN THE NORTH CORNER OF THE ROOM; ITHAS BEEN COLD FOR MANY YEARS. Á DOORWAYLEADS INTO WHAT APPEARS TO BE A SMALLPANTRY.^ÓEVERAL DIFFERENTLY SIZED HUMANSKELETONS ARE CLUSTERED IN GROUPSAROUND THE CENTRAL CIRCULAR TABLE; MOSTARE WEARING TATTERED RAGS AND SOME HAVETHEIR FORKS HALFWAY TO THEIR MOUTHS;ONE HAPLESS DINER WAS IN THE PROCESS OFCHEWING WHEN HE DIED. ÔO THE WEST IS ASTONE ARCHWAY THROUGH WHICH YOU SEE AKITCHEN.^
