^ÔO SAY THAT THIS PLACE IS A DUST BOWLWOULD BE ENTIRELY CORRECT. ÉN FACT,THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT THIS PLACE ÉÓ. ÁGIANT DUST BOWL. (ÓORRY, IT'S NOTHINGLIKE A SUGAR BOWL OR EVEN THE ÓUPERÂOWL.) ÔHE WIND WHIPS STINGING SANDGRANULES INTO YOUR FACE WITH PAINFULACCURACY.^ÙOU STUMBLE OVER THE ROUGH GROUND,CURSING THE LACK OF A PATH. ÔWO STATELYPINE TREES STAND HERE TO YOUR RIGHT. ÔOTHE EAST LIES A DARK TUNNEL LEADINGINTO A HILLSIDE. ÔO THE WEST IS A GIANTEXPANSE OF SHIFTING SANDS. ÌEADINGSOUTH, A PATH WINDS UP TO A WINDSWEPTHILLTOP.^ÔHIS ALMOST-BUT-NOT-QUITE PITCH BLACKHOLE IN THE GROUND IS HARD TO NAVIGATEAROUND, THERE ARE LOTS OF BUMPS ANDROCKS YOU KEEP TRIPPING OVER. ÁS NEARAS YOU CAN TELL, THERE ARE EXITS TO THEWEST AND SOUTH.^ÔHIS ROOM IS LAVISHLY ADORNED WITHLIKENESSES OF HUMMINGBIRDS ON THEWALLS, FLOOR, CEILING, AND ALTAR.^ÙOU STAND IN A QUIET HALL. ÁMULTICOLORED BEADED CURTAIN HANGSBETWEEN YOU AND THE GUEST QUARTERS.ÓMOOTH TILES, AQUA HUED, CHILL YOURFEET.^ÙOU STAND JUST BEHIND A SPARKLING AZUREPOOL. ÔHE WATER IS CALM AND YOU CAN SEETHE TINY BLUE TILES ON THE BOTTOM.^ÙOU NOTICE SEVERAL PRIESTESSES LYINGDOWN ON SIMPLE MATS, RESTING FROM THEEXERTION OF PRAYING.  ÔHE WALLS ARECOVERED IN MASKS AND TAPESTRIES.^ÔHIS LEDGE IS TERRIFYINGLY STEEP. ÙOUKICK A PEBBLE OVER THE EDGE, LISTENINGFOR ANY NOISE. ÙOU DON'T HEAR ANY.^ÔO THE EAST IS AN UNDERGROUND RIVER.ÔO THE SOUTH APPEAR TO BE SOMECATACOMBS. ÔO THE NORTH IS A WINDINGTRAIL.^ÔHIS WIDE, DARK ROARING RIVER FLOWSSWIFTLY TOWARDS THE EAST.^
