  Totally Awesome Dungeon Adventure [-] Command Summary: Dungeon Area [-]

 If you see a [More/Q] prompt at the bottom of your screen: any key continues,
 [Q] quits reading.

  Letters to the left of commands mean certain things:

  to perform the desired action on.

  the specified object. For more detailed information, see [Help Parameters].
